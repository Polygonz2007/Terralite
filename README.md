Welcome to Tertalite, a game made with Raylib in C about exploration.
TerraLITE becuase Terra will be an earth simulation program x will make, which will use much more complicated systems than this. Particles and grids and octrees and sooo ooon!

This is mostly a learning project, it is the first project x make proper use of structs and header files to do most of the work.
x also use this to learn about implementing shaders, marching cubes, objects, and more in C, and how to dynamically use memory as needed.
A.K.A x am trying to make memory management and other stuff here yessssss so cool!
